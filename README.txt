There are two ways in which this project can be run once you have installed Python on your machine. 

1. If you have an IDE like PyCharm on your machine:
  -Downlaod the repository as a .zip file
  -Extract the zip file using winRAR or some other application
  -Open the main branch in PyCharm as a project.
  -The virual environment has already been made and is present as the 'venv' folder in the repository.
  Go to the PyCharm settings File>Settings>Project:[project name]>Project interpreter and specify the path "...\venv\Scripts\python.exe"
  -Open the terminal in PyCharm and run "python app.py"
  -This will run the project invoking a localhost link in terminal.
  -Click on the project to view the visualization in a web brower.
  
2. If you do not have any IDE then use the default OS terminal (cmd/ unix)
  -Download and extract the repository.
  -open the terminal and navigate to the extracted folder by usind the "cd" command.
  -After opening the root folder in the terminal, type "venv\Scripts\activate.bat" to activate the virtual environment with installed dependencies.
  -(venv) should now be visible at the start of each line.
  -run "python app.py" to execute the code.
  -A localhost link is displayed on the screen. Copy and paste this address in a browser to view the visualization.
