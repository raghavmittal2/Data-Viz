INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THIS PROJECT ON A LOCAL MACHINE
Pre-requisite- You must have Python 3.x installed and added to the path on your machine before running the actual code.
There are two ways in which this project can be run once you have installed Python on your machine. 

1. If you have an IDE like PyCharm on your machine:
  -Downlaod the repository as a .zip file
  -Extract the zip file using winRAR or some other application
  -Open the main branch in PyCharm as a project.
  -The virual environment has already been made and is present as the 'venv' folder in the repository.
  Go to the PyCharm settings File>Settings>Project:[project name]>Project interpreter and specify the path "...\venv\Scripts\python.exe"
  -Open the terminal in PyCharm and run "python app.py"
  -This will run the project invoking a localhost link in terminal.
  -Click on the project to view the visualization in a web brower.
  
2. If you do not have any IDE then use the default OS terminal (cmd/ unix)
  -Download and extract the repository.
  -open the terminal and navigate to the extracted folder by using the "cd" command.
  -After opening the root folder in the terminal, type "venv\Scripts\activate.bat" to activate the virtual environment with installed dependencies.
  -(venv) should now be visible at the start of each line.
  -run "python app.py" to execute the code.
  -A localhost link is displayed on the screen. Copy and paste this address in a browser to view the visualization.
